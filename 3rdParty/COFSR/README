This is the COFSR Matlab toolbox which provides a
Continuous Optimization Framework for Switched Regression 
(and hybrid system identification)

written by F. Lauer.

* To install the toolbox, just add its directory and all sub-directories to the PATH, 
or run 

setup.m

* Then type 'help cofsr' to see how to use the main function. 

* A small demo program is provided in 'example.m'


* References: the toolbox implements the method described in 

F. Lauer, R. Vidal, G. Bloch, A continuous optimization framework for hybrid system identification,
Automatica, 47(3):608-613, 2011.

For your convenience, this toolbox also includes the code by Huyer and Neumaier for 
the MCS algorithm as described in 

W. Huyer and A. Neumaier, Global optimization by multilevel coordinate search, 
J. Global Optimization 14 (1999), 331-355.
